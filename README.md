##All your crime are belong to us

Crime is a regular occurence in Champaign-Urbana. But right now, law enforcement officers and those in the criminal justice system simply don't have the tools to understand the data they log daily.

This tool has been built to give* **all citizens** the ability to understand what's going on around them.

###What it does:
The Daily Illini Blotter scrapes data posted in PDFs on Urbana and Champaign's police department websites.

### Our ultimate goal:
We want to be able to holistically track crime where we live. We want to empower citizens to point out when things are going wrong.
