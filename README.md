##All your crime are belong to us

Crime is a regular occurence in Champaign-Urbana. But right now, law enforcement officers and those in the criminal justice system simply don't have the tools to understand the data they log daily.

This tool has been built to give **all citizens** the ability to understand what's going on around them.

###What it does:
The Daily Illini Blotter scrapes data posted on a semi-daily basis in PDFs on the police department websites of [Urbana](http://www.city.urbana.il.us/_Police_Media_Reports/) and Champaign(http://archive.ci.champaign.il.us/cpd-reports/). Geocoding this information, Blotter keeps track of trends in neighborhoods, communicating results of analysis in writing and visualization, while tracking the progression of certain crimes in the criminal justice system, integrating the data pulled from the circuit court system and county jail.

### Our ultimate goal:
We want to be able to answer all of the questions about crime and punishment in Champaign-Urbana, known and unknown. We want to give researchers the tools to tackle the most pressing social issues, and citizens the power to understand what's going on around them.
